# drem-soundscape

A standalone desktop application for creating personal soundscapes by layering and looping sound files. Built with [JUCE](https://juce.com/).

Designed for relaxation, focus, sleep, and meditation.

## Features

- **Multi-file layering** — Load one or more sound files and play them simultaneously
- **Independent playback** — Each file has its own playhead and loop start/end markers, looping indefinitely
- **Visual playback state** — The GUI clearly displays each file's current playhead position, loop region, and playback status
- **Preset system** — Save and recall soundscape configurations (file selections, loop markers, and settings)

## Building

Requires a C++ compiler and CMake. JUCE is included as a git submodule.

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

Build instructions TBD as the project develops.

## License
